## Website Description:
The website, named "TeamTalks," revolves around football podcasts. Users can create an account to access the site's full functionality. Administrators can enter the admin password to create staff accounts, but this privilege is restricted to administrators only.

The site hosts a substantial database of football podcasts, akin to IMDb. Users can search for podcasts based on ratings or producers and leave their own ratings and comments, visible to others.

Staff users have access to a slightly modified version of the website. They can create, update, and delete content but are unable to leave ratings or comments.

Additionally, the website features other functionalities such as a "Contact Us" page.
